# OPENGL_ENGINE
This is my attempt at creating a C++ game engine using OPENGL. This is primarily designed for linux systems. 

The goal of this engine is NOT to create the most advanced, best looking engine out there. Instead, here are the current goals:

- Highly optimized (not good at that part yet)
- Modular: easy to take apart and put back together aspects
- Mod-able: hopefully people can more easily build on top of the games being made here
- Retro-style: make it look and feel like late 90's, early 2000's 3D games
- Optional higher fidelity options: nothing too crazy, but it will be figured out as I go
- Randomly Generated world system that is not repetitive feeling
- Decent enemy AI

- Learning how to make a decent game engine for personal useage


On the note of moddablity, the hope is creating a scripting language way down the line that also has client-side multiplayer capbalities.
Like GZDoom, but the issue there is getting custom functions to work. This is still way down the line.




IMMEDIATE TODO LIST (might as well just put it here):
- add obj import support
